"SQUID GAME" — A FICTIONAL DRAMA FROM SOUTH KOREA — IS NETFLIX'S "BIGGEST-EVER SERIES AT LAUNCH," THE STREAMING COMPANY EXCLUSIVELY TOLD CNN ON TUESDAY.
THE DYSTOPIAN SERIES, IN WHICH CONTESTANTS WHO ARE DEEPLY IN NEED OF MONEY PLAY DEADLY CHILDREN'S GAMES TO WIN CASH PRIZES, HAS BEEN VIEWED BY 111 MILLION ACCOUNTS SINCE DEBUTING ON NETFLIX SEPTEMBER 17.
TO GIVE THAT NUMBER SOME CONTEXT, NETFLIX ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT 82 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WATCHED "BRIDGERTON" IN THE FIRST 28 DAYS FOLLOWING ITS CHRISTMAS DEBUT. "SQUID GAME" SURPASSED THAT NUMBER IN A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME.
